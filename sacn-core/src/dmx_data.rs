#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! This module contains types that deal with the actual dmx data
//!
//! DMX data is not juste the 512 data values, but also:
//! - which universe it was sent on
//! - a potential sync universe
//! - the priority
//! - a potential source cid
//! - is it preview data?
//! - when was it received
